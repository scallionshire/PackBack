Pack Back Development Notes and History

Pack Back BETA1 Bugs and Unresolved Issues (first prototype)

1. Upon entering the game play screen after clicking the play game button on the main menu, if the player clicks the orange button in the top left to return them to the main menu screen, the play game button will dissapear and the player cannot return to the game

2. Upon fullscreen-ing the game window, the game itself does not resize and the newly visible area in the window is a grey blank space

3. When items are placed into the droppable areas they can sit along the edge of droppable areas or overlap with other objects.
  --> items should be placable within the droppable area but not touching the edges
   ----> if items are placed on top of another item or on top of a droppable area edge, the items should snap back to their original load positions.

4. TBA as more issues are encountered.
